```python
# ===== DATA SOURCES REQUIRED =====
# INPUT:
#   - ticker symbols (array)
#   - end_date (string)
#   - API_KEY (string)

# OUTPUT:
#   - Financial metrics (ROE, P/E ratio, etc.)

Can span multiple lines
'''
```

### Variables (Store Data)
```python
agent_name = "Warren Buffett"
confidence = 85.5
is_bullish = True
```

### Functions (Reusable Code)
```python
def analyze_stock(ticker):
    """Analyze a stock and return signal"""
    return "bullish"
```

### Lists and Dictionaries (Collections)
```python
tickers = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT"]
result = {"signal": "buy", "confidence": 90}
```

---

## How to Test

### Simple Test:
```python
# Test your function
result = analyze_stock("AAPL")
print(result)  # Should print "bullish"
```

### How to Run:
- **VS Code**: Press F5
- **Command Line**: `python your_file.py`
- **PyCharm**: Right-click → Run

### Test Checklist:
✅ Code runs without errors
✅ Output looks correct
✅ Comments explain what code does

## Common Tasks

### 1. Add Comments
```python
# ===== DATA SOURCES REQUIRED =====
# INPUT: ticker symbols, end_date, API_KEY
# OUTPUT: financial metrics, analysis results
# PARAMETERS: period, limit
```

### 2. Fix Typos
- Read through code
- Fix spelling errors in comments
- Correct variable names

### 3. Add Simple Functions
```python
def calculate_simple_moving_average(prices, period=20):
    """Calculate moving average"""
    if len(prices) < period:
        return None
    return sum(prices[-period:]) / period
```

### 4. Improve Error Messages
```python
# Before: return "Error"
# After: return "Invalid ticker symbol format"
```
