(For Complete List Of Manufactured Products, See Source, Pp. 133-135) These Covered Commodities Include Some Which Were Classified Directly As Construction Materials, And Another Group Of ""Mixed Commodities,"" Such As Lumber, Wrought Pipe, And Statuary And Art Goods, For Which The Proportion Allotable To Construction Materials Was Estimated. Value Estimates Exclude Costs After Production, Such As Transportation And Distribution Costs. For The Period 1869-1919, Output, Exports, And Imports Were Estimated As Follows. Estimates Of The Value Of Output Are Based Primarily On The""Census Of Manufactures"", Decennially, 1869-1899, And Quinquennially, 1899- 1919. Intercensal Estimates Were Developed From State Statistical Reports For Seven States (See Source, Pp. 232-233), Figures From Governmental Agencies Such As The Bureau Of Mines, And The Department Of Agriculture, And From Trade Associations Such As The American Iron And Steel Institute (See Source, Pp. 241-242). Exports Were Compiled From Detailed Statistics In The December Issues Of The""Monthly Summary Of Foreign Commerce"" For 1893-1919. For 1869, And 1889-1893, Calendar-Year Totals Were Derived From The""Quarterly Report Of The Chief Of The Bureau Of Statistics"", U.S.Treasury Department. These Basic Export Statistics Were Modified As To Classification Of Commodities, And Were Adjusted To Price Levels Comparable With The Output Data (Manufacturers' Or Producers' Prices). Imports For Consumption, Including Duties, Were Obtained From Fiscal- Year Data In""Foreign Commerce And Navigation"", And Were Adjusted To A Calendar- Year Basis. For The Period 1919-33, The Data Are Based On Kuznets' Estimates (""Commodity Flow And Capital Formation"", I, New York, NBER, 1938), Adjusted To Improve Comparability With Earlier Years. Ratios Of Kuznets' Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Consumption To His Unadjusted Value Of Domestic Output Were Computed For 1919 And 1929 And Interpolated For Intervening Years. These Ratios Were Applied To Kuznets' Adjusted Output Values. After 1933 The Estimates Are Rough Extrapolations. Values In 1913 Prices Were Derived By Applying Price Indexes To The Current Price Series. For 1914-39, Bureau Of Labor Statistics Indexes For Lumber And Building Materials And For Steel Rails Were Combined, Using 1926 Weights. For 1890-1913, A Similar Composite, Using 1909 Weights, Was Combined With An Index Of Structural Steel Prices, Computed From""Metal Statistics"", 1938. For Years Before 1890, Series On Eleven Commodities Were Combined, Using 1909 Bls Weights, And The Resulting Index Was Linked To The Series For Later Years. See Lipsey And Preston, Pp. 284-285.

For 1947-52, The Weights Were Based On 1947 Value Added Data; However, The Weighted Index Was Linked In January 1953 To A Weighted Index (In The 1959 Resivion) And Subsequently Converted To The Present Reference Period Of 1957-59.

These Units May Be Subsidiaries, Divisions, Departments, Or Plants, Depending Upon The Structure And Activities Of The Particular Firm.

As An Interim Procedure, Pending Further Study Of The Proper Level For August 1962 Was Established By Relating The Ratio Of Unfilled Orders To Shipments (From The Sample) To The August 1962 Shipments Estimates For Each Detailed Category. The Estimates For New Orders Are Net Of Cancellations. They Are Derived By Adding The Change In Unfilled Orders Between The Current And Previous Month To The Shipments Estimate. Tabulation Of The Series On The New Benchmark Basis Was Begun With January 1960 Data. Approximately Comparable Monthly Data Were Developed For 1953-1959. Seasonal Adjustment Is By The Source.

This Index Measures Changes In The Physical Volume Of Production Of Clay, Glass, And Stone Manufactured Products. It Does Not Cover Stone And Earth Minerals. It Is Based On Production Or Shipments Data From The Bureau Of The Census, The Bureau Of Mines, And Trade Associations, Such As The American Glassware Association; And On Bls Man-Hours Data. The Index Is Available On The 1957-59 Base Only From 1947; For Earlier Years The Latest Data Are On A 1935-39 Base. This Series Is Therefore Shown Here In Two Segments With An Overlap Of One Year. Most Clay, Glass, And Stone Products (85 Per Cent Of The Output In 1957-59) Are Classified As Construction Materials And Are Included In The Index For That Market Group. In 1957-59 They Accounted For Over One- Quarter Of Total Production Of Construction Materials. Major Revisions Of The Clay, Glass, And Stone Index Were Made In 1940, 1943, 1953, 1959, And 1962. In Addition To Changes In The Base Period, The Revisions Affected The Composition Of The Index, Weighting, Adjustment To Benchmark Levels, Types Of Basic Data Used, And Method Of Seasonal Adjustment. Seasonal And Working-Day Adjustments Are By The Source. For A Detailed Description Of The Index And The Revisions, See Above Sources And""Federal Reserve Bulletin"", December 1953.

The Annual Value-Put-In-Place Data Represent Annual Expenditure Estimates Prepared By The Bureau Of Public Roads. Monthly Data On Value Put In Place For Federal-Aid Highways (Interstate And State) Are Based On Bpr Monthly Estimates, Adjusted To The Level Of The Annual Expenditure Estimates For This Category Of Highways. Monthly Data For All Other Highways Are Based On The Annual Expenditure Estimates, Distributed Monthly By Applying Seasonal Indexes Computed From Final Data For Federally Aided State Highways. The Final Bpr Annual Estimates Do Not Become Available Until Two Years After The Period Reported. Data Published Before That Time Are Preliminary Figures Based On Projections Made By The Bpr. The Procedure For Estimating Value Of Highway Construction Put In Place Was Revised In 1963. In 1964 Data Were Revised Back To 1946. The Revised Data Are Considered Comparable With Data For Earlier Periods. The Constant Dollar Series Is Derived From A Quarterly Cost Index Of The Bureau Of Public Roads, Interpolated Monthly By The ""Engineering News-Record"" Index.
