Coal And Steel Strikes Ending In November 1949 Accounted For High Unemployment In October 1949. Also, A Large Number Of Coaal Miners And Steel Workers, Reported As Looking For Work In October, Were Later Classified As ""With A Job But Not At Work,"" Which Led To The Decline In Unemployment In November (See Monthly Labor Review, Bls, December 1949). The Usual Decline In Unemployment From September To October Did Not Occur In 1949. Therefore The Use Of The Low Seasonal Index Distorted The Seasonally Adjusted Figures For October. The Sample Was Changed In January 1954 To 230-Area Sample. Figures For 1953 Were Revised Accordingly From September-December So The Series Is Continuous (For The Unrevised Figures See Current Population Report, P-50, No. 59, 1954 Anual, P. 53).
