Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.  Scope and History The index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.  Public Data and Proprietary Methodology We use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)  Measured on a 100 Point Scale Financial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.  The Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer’s position. Less than 60 Emergency / Crisis 60 – 69 Distressed / Unstable 70 – 79 Weakening / At-Risk 80 – 89 Good / Stable 90 and Above Excellent / Secure  What Does the Index Measure? We measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life—Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.  Employment. Stable income is the foundation of any family’s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health. Key Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment Sample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics  Housing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances. Key Measures: Mortgage and Rental Delinquencies, Housing as Percent of Budget Sample Data Source: National Delinquency Survey  Credit. Responsible use of credit creates more borrowing options and lower costs. This category assesses the strength of credit scores and how well families manage their credit. Key Measures: Credit Scores, Trade Line Utilization, Credit Delinquencies, Per Capita Bankruptcies Sample Data Source: National Credit Bureau  Household Budget. Spending less than you make is the daily choice that leads to long-term success. This category measures families’ spending patterns and saving for emergencies. Key Measures: Disposable Income, Savings, Consumer Confidence Sample Data Source: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis  Net Worth. Strong, positive net worth creates options and independence. This category measures how well consumers are strengthening their personal balance sheets. Key Measures: Household Net Worth, Net Worth versus Funds Required for Long-Term Needs (e.g. retirement) Sample Data Source: Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, Survey of Consumer Finances"

The Census Bureau has changed the methodology for computing median income over time. The Census Bureau has computed medians using either Pareto interpolation or linear interpolation. Currently, we are using linear interpolation to estimate all medians. Pareto interpolation assumes a decreasing density of population within an income interval, whereas linear interpolation assumes a constant density of population within an income interval. The Census Bureau calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1979 through 1987 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $20,000 for people or $40,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500.  We calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976, 1977, and 1978 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $1,000. All other estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976 through 2011 (2012 ASEC) and almost all of the estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1975 and earlier were calculated using linear interpolation.  Thus, use caution when comparing median incomes above $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households for different years. Median incomes below those levels are more comparable from year to year since they have always been calculated using linear interpolation. For an indication of the comparability of medians calculated using Pareto interpolation with medians calculated using linear interpolation, see Series P-60, Number 114, Money Income in 1976 of Families and Persons in the United States (www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/p60-114.pdf)."

It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.  Home types captured in ZHVI include single-family residences, condos, and co-ops.  A single-family home is a standalone, detached house used as a single dwelling unit, meaning a residence for one family, person or household. It has its own private entrance and direct street access, and is built on its own land, usually with additional yard space.  An owner-occupied apartment is generally referred to as a condominium or condo. The public common areas are jointly-owned and usually managed by a homeowners association (HOA).  A cooperative, or co-op, is a type of housing that is actually a corporation. A co-op resembles a condominium but the unit owners do not own their unit outright. Each resident owns a share in a corporation that entitles them to live in one of the units under a lease agreement.  For more information on types of houses, check out Zillow's types of houses article (https://www.zillow.com/resources/stay-informed/types-of-houses/).
