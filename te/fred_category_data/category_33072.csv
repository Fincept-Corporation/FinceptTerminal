Source, P.59. For 1919-1925, The Old Index Was Used. For 1926-1929, A Revision Of The Index, First Computed In January, 1922, Based Upon 194 Securities In 25 Groups, With Each Security Given The Weight Of 100 Francs In The Base Period 1901-1910. This Gave Rise To Certain Difficulties, Because As One Moves Away From The Base Period, Different Stocks Begin To Be Weighted Very Differently (And Not Necesarily Justifiably). What Was Done Then, Was To Compute For Each Security Its Value In January, 1926 When Referred To A Base Whose Base Was Its Average Value In 1925. These Were Then Averaged Together, So That Each Security Was Weighted Equally In 1925, And The Whole Group Then Referred Back To 1913. The Earlier Index (From 1919-1925) Was Kept The Same Except That It Was Converted From The Base 1901-1910 To 1913. But January, 1926 Of The New Index (From 1919-1925) Was Made Equal To The Old Index (211) And After January, 1926, The Series Referred To 288 Securities In 20 Groups. The Groups And The Number Of Securities Included In Each Group Are As Follows: Banks (13); Textile Industries (13); Insurance Companies (15); Railroads, Great Systems (10); Coal Mines Of The Center (7); Railroads, Miscellaneous And Urban Transport--France, Algeria, And Tunis (14); Coal Mines Of The North (11); Miscellaneous Mines--France, Algeria, And Tunis (9); Transportation--Water (9); Iron And Steel Works (13); Gas (12); Metal Works, Mechanical And Electrical Construction (24); Electricity (23); Diverse Industries (22); Shipbuilding (7); Miscellaneous Trading (16); Buliding Materials (11); Colonial Companies (25); Chemical Products (16); French Companies Operating Abroad (18). The Old Index Consisted Of These Groups And Number Of Securities Their Respective Numbers Of Securities: Banks And Credit Institutions (13); Miscellaneous French And Colonial Railroads (10); Coal Mines Of The Loire And Center (5); Urban Transport (6); Navigation (6); Docks And Piers (3); Coal Mines Of The North (10); Iron And Steel Works (10); Metal Mines (4); Suez Canal (1); Metals (4); Mechanical Construction (5); Gas (12); Shipbuilding (5); Water (4); Electricity (26); Materials And Miscellaneous""Ontillages"" (4); Foodstuffs And Mineral Waters (13); Chemical Products--Salts And Phosphates (11); Building Materials (5); Printing (4); Department Stores (4); Foreign Railroads (8); Textiles (2); French Railroads, Major Systems (5). These Have Been Corrected For Changes In Capitalization And Distribution Of Reserves. See Bulletin, January, 1932, P.243 And Following, For 1932 Revisions. The Method And Base Remained The Same, But In 1929, The Number Of Securities Changed From 288 In 20 Groups To 300 In 22 Groups. The New Groups And The Respective Number Of Securities In Each Group Is As Follows: Banques (20); Railroads, Miscellaneous And Urban (13); Assurances (15); Hauilleres Du Centre (8); Navigation (9); Hauilleres Du Nord (11); Gas (12); Miscellaneous Mining (8); Electricity (21); Iron And Steel (13); Food--Alimentation (14); Mechanical Construction(24); Large Warehouses--Grands Magasins (8); Shipbuilding (6); Building Materials (13); Miscellaneous Industries (16); Chemical Products (16); Miscellaneous Trading (12); Textile Industry (16); Colonial Companies (20); Railroads, Large Systems (10); French Companies Operating Abroad(15).
