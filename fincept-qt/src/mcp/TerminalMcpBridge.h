// TerminalMcpBridge.h — Local HTTP bridge that exposes the internal MCP tool
// catalog to the Python `finagent_core` agent subprocess.
//
// The Python side (`scripts/agents/finagent_core/tools/terminal_toolkit.py`)
// already speaks this contract:
//
//   POST <endpoint>/tool       body: {id, tool, args}   → ToolResult JSON
//   (optional) GET <endpoint>/tools                     → [{name, description, inputSchema}]
//
// Auth: every request must include `X-MCP-Token: <token>`, compared in constant
// time. Two kinds of token are accepted: the per-process UUID (`token()`), and
// a per-run UUID minted by `begin_run()` that additionally binds that agent's
// own tool filter to dispatch. AgentService injects one into the agent config
// payload. Agents share the parent's user session, so the token only guards
// against OTHER local processes stumbling onto the port.
//
// Every request is also checked against auth/LoopbackGuard.h (Host must be our
// own loopback authority; no cross-site fetch metadata), which is what stops a
// web page the user has open — or a DNS-rebound hostname — from driving this
// port. This endpoint is machine-to-machine, so cross-site navigations are
// rejected too.
//
// Transport: QTcpServer + manual HTTP/1.1 framing (Qt6::HttpServer is not
// available in this Qt 6.8.3 build). Localhost-only binding on 127.0.0.1:0
// (OS-assigned port). Connection: close after each response — no keep-alive.
