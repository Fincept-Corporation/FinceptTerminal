/// The plan calls for `WindowFrame` to shed concerns it shouldn't own —
/// authentication, lock state, services init, theme, profile — into a place
/// that survives window creation and destruction. That place is `TerminalShell`.
///
/// Phase 1 ships the **skeleton**:
///   - `initialise()` is the formal "shell came up" event. main.cpp calls it
///     immediately after constructing QApplication. The implementation today
///     wires nothing new — just confirms the invariants and emits started().
///   - The shell exposes accessors for the registries it owns (just refs to
///     the existing singletons). These accessors give Phase 2-9 code a single
///     ergonomic entry point: `TerminalShell::instance().window_registry()`
///     instead of `WindowRegistry::instance()` everywhere.
///
/// Phase 1b lifts auth + lock + InactivityGuard ownership into the shell and
/// installs `LockOverlayController`. That work needs careful coordination
/// with the PIN security audit invariants and is staged separately. For now
/// existing auth/lock paths in WindowFrame keep working unchanged.
///
/// Threading: UI-thread only. There is exactly one TerminalShell per process.
/// Calling instance() from a worker thread is a bug.
