## 📞 Implementation Support

This framework converts Henry Kissinger's diplomatic history approach into AI agents that analyze current events through the lens of different civilizational concepts of world order, emphasizing historical continuity and realpolitik calculations.

For each agent, focus on showing how historical patterns and civilizational concepts shape modern international behavior, following Kissinger's emphasis on understanding each order system on its own terms.
